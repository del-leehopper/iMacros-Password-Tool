# iMacros-Password-Tool
The tool at https://demo.imacros.net/PasswordTool.aspx no longer works. I have reverse engineered it and created the following for those that need it. 

This can run locally so no need to risk passwords being sent through the internet. 

## Instructions
<ol>
  <li>Download the files into a folder</li>
  <li>Open the "index.html" file in the browser of your choice</li>
  <li>Enter your details in the relevant fields</li>
</ol>

I hope this helps others who are stuck!
