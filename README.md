# iMacros-Password-Tool
The tool at https://demo.imacros.net/PasswordTool.aspx no longer works. I have reverse engineered it and created the following for those that need it. This can run locally so no need to risk passwords being sent through the internet. Just download the files into a folder and open the "index.html" file. I hope this helps others who are stuck!
